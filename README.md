# New Prizm Icon Design Guide

### Style:
So with the update, Casio did away with the colorful 3D style main object and replaced it with a white 2D object that has a drop shadow. Also, they now fit in a 82x38 rounded rectangle, so there's less space to work with.

To get started, download the template psd and open it up in Photoshop or GIMP.

The rounded rectangle can be whatever color you choose, but to get the closest resemblence to Casio's icons I created an overlay that adds a gradient. To create your own color, follow these steps in whichever program you use:

1. Fill the Color layer with your desired color

#### For Photoshop:

2. Go to "Filter > Noise > Add Noise..." and use these settings: 1%, Gaussian, Monochromatic

#### For GIMP:

2. Go to "Filters > Noise > HSV Noise..." and use these settings: Dulling - 2, Hue - 3.00, Saturation - 0.040, Value - 0.040

The overlays and backgrounds should be self explanitory from there, you can just change the visibility.

When saving in Photoshop, the default BMP settings should work fine and in GIMP, export as BMP and change it to 24 bit under the advanced options when prompted.

The end results should be similar to this:
